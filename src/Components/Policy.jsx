          We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written

          personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information,
          subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by

          activities.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Right to be informed — Request to know</strong></p>
        <p>
          Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:

        <p>
          In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer
          information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify
          individual data to verify a consumer request.

        <p><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</strong></p>

        <p className="mb-4">We do not process consumer’s sensitive personal information.</p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Verification process</h3>
        <p>
          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the
          same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts
          require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you
          have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
          may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide
          with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication
          method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
          verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
          authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
          information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
          identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
          additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
          fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as
          we finish verifying you.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Other privacy rights</h3>
        <p>
          You may object to the processing of your personal information. You may request correction
          of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the
          processing of the information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We
          may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
          validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to
          third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as
          feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request
          submission.
